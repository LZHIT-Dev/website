### How does inLuShan work and does it steal my private information?

inLuShan provides its services to you through a "Micro-Service" provider called FinClip.

inLuShan does not collect any information you enter on any page during its operation, all the information you enter in inLuShan is stored locally.

### inLuShan and LZHIT.

It is especially important to know that inLuShan was developed by LZHIT students themselves and does not represent the school and is not officially affiliated with LZHIT in any way.

### I am using a device running iOS/iPadOS.

Sorry, although inLuShan uses the technology stack of the cross-system platform React Native technology, the iOS/iPadOS version of inLuShan is not available due to developer device limitations.
